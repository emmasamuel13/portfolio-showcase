This evidence details how I did a biger thing. In it, I demonstrate how I completed lots of duties.

Here is a larger piece of code
```ruby
class PokeSelector
  attr_reader :pokemon

  def initialize
    @pokemon = ['Growlithe', 'Ralts', 'Shpheal']
  end

  def select_pokemon
    pokemon.sample
  end
end

p = PokeSelector.new
p.select_pokemon
=> "Ralts"
```
